This project aims to develop an open-source framework for creating IVR applications.
Recent version 0.1 of AeroIVR application can handle many connections from softphones using H.323 and play selected WAV file.

Web interface is used to administer application server which is handling user's calls.

In future this is planned to developed full featured IVR open-source framework for easy creation of the IVR applications not only for H.323 protocol.

Feel free to download sources and try application.
